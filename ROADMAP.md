# per-device-eq Roadmap

Goal: any output device corrected through per-device-eq should sound the
same to *this* listener — measured correction per device, taste per
listener, headroom that never lies.

---

## Shipped

- **Measurement.** The app is the instrument: Farina sweep out through the
  selected sink, capture from the rig, per-capsule calibration, impulse
  windowing, magnitude-RMS averaging across seatings, SNR-targeted
  auto-leveling, per-take quality gating, and a constrained biquad fit
  with an EQ range that follows the take-to-take spread. Incremental core:
  every take persists the moment it lands; sessions resume; delete + refit
  are first-class.
- **Headroom.** Tier-1 worst-chain estimate composing the taste layer,
  tier-2 live post-EQ meters in the preamp card, an Auto preamp MODE that
  lands the composed Safe (device + taste) and a session clamp that
  absorbs real peaks mid-playback. The fit lands bands only -- the mode
  owns the gain.
- **Taste layer.** Named preference EQs over any profile on any device,
  a Taste card with an in-place editor, picker with rename/delete, and
  honest interaction with headroom.
- **One undo timeline.** Device, taste and profile switches share a
  single history: selection is not an edit, steps are single, births and
  deletions are revocable within the session (the graveyard), and the
  arrows never lie about whether anything would change.
- **Sink honesty.** Edit aims at the profile's own sink; only New picks up
  the current output; a session belongs to its sink — alive or
  Unavailable, no retargeting, no selection stealing.
- **Adaptive UI.** Adw.MultiLayoutView two-column measurement window,
  client-side modality, draw budgets, the PeqView component shared by
  device and taste, cards everywhere (device, taste, preamp, ring,
  takes), and a long tail of layout fixes.
- **Integration and CLI.** `install_full` as the one source behind both
  `--install` and the GUI dialog; `--uninstall`; symmetric
  `--list-sinks` / `--list-sources`; the launcher's tools gate.

## Next (the sprint)

1. **Merged hardware export.** Export the COMPOSED chain (device + active
   taste, preamp included) as one parametric-EQ text for hardware and
   apps that cannot layer: EqualizerAPO/Qudelix-style. Accept when the
   exported file null-tests against the in-app chain within 0.1 dB across
   the fit band, and the per-channel collapse policy is stated in the
   header comment.
2. **Profile package.** One-file `.pdeq` bundle: profile + measurement +
   fit provenance + rig fingerprint + content sha. Import validates and
   shows provenance. Accept when export→import roundtrips byte-stable.
   This is the foundation the exchange service stands on.
3. **GNOME HIG pass.** A written checklist in-repo (spacing scale, focus
   order, keyboard mnemonics, symbolic icons, header-bar patterns,
   dialog vs popover usage, About window), every deviation fixed or
   argued in place. Accept when each line carries a check or a commit.
4. **CI that sees the GUI.** Actions running pytest + pyflakes +
   `gtk4-builder-tool validate` over every `.ui`, plus a headless import
   smoke of the Gtk modules. Accept when the classes of breakage we have
   actually shipped past the sandbox (bad `.ui`, import-time errors) turn
   the build red.
5. **Flathub.** Manifest, metainfo, screenshots, release notes.
   Popularity starts with installability.

## Direction

- **Targets (the debate).** Fit to arbitrary magnitude curves -- Harman
  IE/OE and friends -- as a property of the MEASUREMENT frame, not of
  taste. Pro: on a coupler/pinna rig, flat-at-the-mic is not the
  perceptual goal; a target bound to the rig makes profiles portable
  truth and keeps taste layers transferable across devices measured on
  different rigs. Contra: provenance and frame-compatibility machinery.
  Deciding experiment: an EARS-flat profile plus a taste layer on one
  IEM should match an EARS-to-Harman profile without taste, by ear and
  by curve; if it does not, targets earn their complexity.
- **Profile exchange service.** Static, sha-addressed index of `.pdeq`
  packages first (a git repo can be the backend); accounts, ratings and
  comments only if the static thing proves too small.
- **Verified measurements.** Opt-in device-fingerprint sharing once the
  service exists, a popularity list, and the maintainer verifying the
  top of it -- by buying and measuring, or by cross-checking submitted
  packages against published curves.
- **Hardware PEQ, the full story.** Per-device capability tables (band
  counts, Q ranges, shelf types, preamp granularity), bank naming and
  multi-bank export where the hardware has them.
- **Android.** Survey the global-PEQ hosts (Wavelet,
  RootlessJamesDSP-class engines) for a profile handoff format; a
  companion exporter, not a port.
- **Advocacy.** Write-ups of the established facts below (the BT
  loudness/limiter findings deserve their own post), short demo videos,
  and a comparison page against static AutoEq presets.

## Parked

- **Profile state journal** (old Task 4): log band edits / bypass / preamp
  changes with timestamps; `--dump-state` for measurement notes.
- **Hardware: 711-clone coupler** (old Task 5): buy an IEC 60318-4 clone,
  verify against 3–4 IEMs with published curves, record its trusted
  range. EARS remains for over-ears and same-rig deltas.
- **Upstream: DeaDBeeF SRC + pipewire-alsa** (old Task 6): file with a
  synthetic repro; two rate converters with conflicting ratio views.

---

## Established facts worth not re-deriving

- Sink monitor in in-node topology = **pre-EQ** (Bypass-toggle experiment);
  post-EQ level must be computed, which the meter does.
- BT absolute volume does not protect against quantization clipping;
  software stream gain does.
- Constant BT latency is harmless to sweep FR; clock drift and timing
  references are the actual hazards — average by magnitude only, never
  time-domain, and never use an acoustic timing reference over BT.
- EARS: trust < ~2 kHz absolute, full range for same-rig deltas; the
  ~2.3 kHz cut is listener-validated by ear, the 14.4 kHz filter trio was
  rig resonance.
- PipeWire's param_eq shelves use plain Q (`alpha = sin(w0)/(2Q)`), not the
  RBJ slope form; `perdeviceeq.eq` and the audit match it to 1e-10.
- Mic calibration files are per-incidence-angle: 0° aimed at the active
  speaker for per-speaker sweeps, 90° up for speakers all around; below
  the room transition they coincide.

## Upstream notes

* **Resolved:** PipeWire filter-graph ate softVolume/softMute so channel
  volumes applied twice and the level collapsed after enabling EQ --
  fixed in 1.6.8 (work item 5344).
* WirePlumber: a fresh `stream.capture.sink` stream against a settled BT
  sink with an in-node filter-graph deterministically comes up with one
  monitor port unlinked; only a node reconfigure (graph republish)
  completes the links. Repro + workaround live in per-device-eq (the
  400 ms republish nudge and the dead-channel watchdog).
* gnome-shell (observed once, repro unknown): the quick-settings output
  picker's checkmark desynced from the actual default sink while
  per-device-eq was active. Capture kit for the next occurrence:
  `pw-metadata 0 default.audio.sink` vs `pactl get-default-sink` vs the
  picker's checkmark — whichever disagrees is the stale layer; run
  `pactl subscribe` during EQ edits to see sink remove/add storms.
